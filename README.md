Introduction
------------

The purpose of this repository, which will be referred to as WikiToLearnHome
(shortened as WTLH), is setting up an instance of [WikiToLearn][WTL] (shortened as
WTL), that can either be a development one (run locally on a laptop, with test
content) or a staging-production one.
Specific characteristics of the different instances of WikiToLearn will be
explained in the documentation.

All the operations can be performed "manually" (without the help of these
scripts), but the whole process is quite tedious and it is extremely easy to
make some errors, thus we highly recommend to use WTLH to setup your
environment.

How to find the documentation
-----------------------------

The WTLH documentaion is written in markdown and stored inside the WTLH repo `doc`
folder. It is then converted into mediawiki with `doc/mediawiki-online.sh`
and imported on [wikitolearn meta page][meta].

We suggest that now you start reading [The Documentation][DOC].

Happy Wiki!
